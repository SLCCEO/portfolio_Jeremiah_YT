        <h2>Why I Switched to Dark Mode by Default</h2>
        <p class="article-meta"><em>Published June 2025</em></p>

        <p>
          For a long time, I kept my website in a traditional light mode. But as I developed more user-focused designs, I realized that starting with dark mode offers better accessibility, energy savings, and modern appeal ‚Äî especially for developers and tech audiences.
        </p>

        <h3>üß† Better for the Eyes</h3>
        <p>
          Dark mode significantly reduces eye strain, especially in low-light environments. For many developers who browse or code late into the night, a darker interface is simply more comfortable.
        </p>

        <h3>üîã Energy Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          On OLED and AMOLED screens, dark mode can save battery life by reducing the number of pixels actively emitting light. It's a subtle touch, but one that makes a real-world difference.
        </p>

        <h3>üé® Modern Look & Feel</h3>
        <p>
          Many users now expect dark mode support. Platforms like GitHub, Discord, VS Code, and macOS have helped normalize it as a default. So I decided my site should match that modern design language.
        </p>

        <h3>‚öôÔ∏è How I Did It</h3>
        <p>
          I created a <code>.dark-mode</code> class that changes background and text color variables. A JavaScript toggle stores the preference in <code>localStorage</code>, allowing users to switch themes easily.
        </p>
        <pre><code>if (localStorage.getItem("theme") === "dark") {
  document.body.classList.add("dark-mode");
}</code></pre>

        <h3>üß© Still Support Light Mode</h3>
        <p>
          Of course, accessibility includes <em>choices</em>. That's why I kept a light mode fallback and a toggle. It‚Äôs not about choosing one side ‚Äî it‚Äôs about offering the best experience for everyone.
        </p>

        <h3>‚úÖ Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Switching to dark mode as default wasn't just an aesthetic decision ‚Äî it was a user-first one. I encourage you to explore your own preferences and offer flexible options in your own designs.
