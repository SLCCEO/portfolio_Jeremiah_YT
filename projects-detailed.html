  <h2>SLC-12: Wraith Glacier</h2>
  <p class="article-meta"><em>Installation Origin • Class-4 Cryo-Research & Training Zone</em></p>
  <p>
    <p>
  Located beneath an ancient glacier, SLC-12 is the original foundation of Singularity Labs Corporation. It is not only a containment site but also a hub for simulation, training, and early recruitment. <strong>All entities in and around the site are uncontained, actively wandering within quarantined sectors or open terrain.</strong> The facility represents the first fully operational zone under SLC ownership following the collapse of SCP foundation.
</p>

  </p>

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Simulation Training Chambers for Tactical and CQC readiness</li>
    <li>On-site recruitment through SLC-12 Programs (Civilians may explore or join)</li>
    <li>Wandering Entities active in surrounding quarantine sectors</li>
    <li>Exterior Civilian Spawn Zones with open exploration access</li>
    <li>Active quarantine zones for anomaly breach containment drills</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Plans & Future Expansion:</h3>
  <p>
    Future developments at SLC-12 will expand its civilian onboarding pipeline, improve outdoor anomaly containment perimeters, and establish layered defense zones around the glacier. It remains a high-traffic onboarding site for new recruits and researchers alike.

        <h2>SLC-09: Iron Warden</h2>
        <p class="article-meta"><em>Central Command Node • Advanced AI Research Hub</em></p>
        <p>
          Serving as the nerve center of Singularity Labs, SLC-09 is the home of the CASIA AI. Built with security in mind, this facility was responsible for the containment of over 200 anomalies, secure intelligence routing, and experimental ethics-driven AI governance.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>CASIA: Command and Support Integrated Assistant</li>
          <li>Multi-tier security clearance system</li>
          <li>Secure blacksite data vaults</li>
          <li>Direct uplink to orbital Iron Rod An nukler Orbital Station able to strike at Anytime By SLC SLC CEC</li>
